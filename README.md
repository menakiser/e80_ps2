# e80_ps2
ECON 80 PS 2

Notes on 1/29:
 - We're assuming every individual is a unique household.
 - Raw trends plotting total or average number of children per year (im thinking two panels treated and untreated)

Questions for Doug 30/10:
- Assumption that each person is different HH? Ok?
- Run by him  outcomes (we include young children becasuse age of youngest child is higher than own age;) and that we are including medicaid and insurance uptake additional to child outcomes
- We are using state & survey year FE, but what is the reasoning behind including state#relative year (-1, 0, 1)?
