\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    In 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid to cover to all low-income adults as opposed to primarily families with children. This study exploits the state differential take-up of this policy to evaluate effects on childbearing decisions in the targeted population. Using 2008-2019 American Community Survey (ACS), we implement a XX design with treatment defined as XX

\section{Data and Strategy}
Our data comes from the 2008-2019 American Community Survey (ACS), obtained through the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) \citep{data:acs}. The ACS is a yearly cross-sectional, one percent, annual survey of households in the United States.

\caption{Math Scores Value Added, Evaluating Multi-Level Covariates}
\adjustbox{ width=\linewidth}{

}
\end{centering}
\begin{spacing}{1} \begin{footnotesize} \textit{Notes:} This table evaluates the effect of covariates at the student, class, teacher, and school level on the value added function for standardized math scores. Column 1 evaluates the effects of the absence rate (days absent/days enrolled) at the student level, the average classroom rate, and the average school level rate, with fixed effects at the grade-school year level. Column 2 focuses on the student rate and incorporates student covariates. Column 3 evaluates all independent variables from Column 1 and incorporates student, classroom, teacher, and school covariates. Column 4 incorporates school level fixed effects. Column 5 incorporates school-grade-year fixed effects. p $<$ 0.01 ***, p $<$ 0.05 **, p $<$0.1 *.

\end{centering}
\begin{spacing}{1} \begin{footnotesize} \textit{Notes:} This table evaluates the effect of student characteristics relative to (or interacted with) class characteristics. Column 1 replicates Column 3 from Table \ref{tab:tcontrols}, serving as a baseline. Column 2 adds an interaction between a student’s relative prior year math score (their previous year’s standardized score minus their class’s average) and their absence rate. Column 3 adds an interaction between a student’s relative gifted program status (their status minus their class share of gifted students) and their absence rate. Column 4 adds an interaction between a student’s relative free/reduced price lunch eligibility (their status minus their class share of eligible free/reduced price lunch) and their absence rate. Column 5 adds an interaction between the class average absence rate and the student absence rate, absence rate is unpacked further in Table \ref{tab:chronic_abs}. p $<$ 0.01 ***, p $<$ 0.05 **, p $<$0.1 *.

\end{centering}
\begin{spacing}{1} \begin{footnotesize} \textit{Notes:} This table evaluates the effect of the absolute absence rate compared with chronic absence, or being absent more than 10\% of the time, as well as the effects of other students in the class and school being chronically absent. Student covariates include a cubic polynomial for their previous test scores; dummies for whether they receive free/reduced lunch (a proxy for poverty), have an individualized education plan (an indicator of special education status), are an English Language Learner, are in the gifted program, or are male; and variables for their race and ethnicity. Teacher covariates include their age, race/ethnicity, experience, level of education, number of students they teach, and dummies for whether they are male and whether they are a new hire. Class covariates include the number of students in the class; the mean math score of the class; and the share of students with the characteristics highlighted in the student covariates. School covariates include the poverty quartile, number of students, school average math scores, and the share of students with the characteristics highlighted in the student covariates. p $<$ 0.01 ***, p $<$ 0.05 **, p $<$0.1 *.  \end{footnotesize}  \end{spacing}
